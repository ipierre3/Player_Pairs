# (5 points): As a pair player, I want a fifty-two (52) deck of cards to be created and stored in a List  (number/type only, no suits). 
        
        # Four of each: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,  Jack, Queen, King
        
        #  HINT: Create a list called “deck”. This list should contain simple string values. For example, the list would contain four 
        # (4) “7” string values to represent the four sevens (7) present in the deck.
            
            # deck = [“Ace”, “Ace”, “Ace”, “Ace”, “2”, “2”, “2”, “2”, “3” ..... ]
